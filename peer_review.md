### Clarity and Organization
- The project follows the structure outlined in the Final Project instructions.
- The format is clear, concise and easy to follow along.
- The README served as a reference with links to the project workbook and peer review.

### Feature Selection & Justification
- Sandra chose the input features: `age`, `bmi`, `children`, `smoker`, `(categorical: yes/no)`, `region`, `(categorical: northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest)`
- The target variable chosen was `charges`
- All of the features chosen have a strong impact on the target variable `charges` and each feature selection was justified.

### Model Performance & Comparisons
- Sandra used a Linear Regression model, a Standard Scaler Linear Regression and a Polynomial Features (Degree=3) Linear Regression Model to predict medical/insurance charges.
- The Polynomial Features (Degree=3) Linear Regression Model outperformed the other two models and Sandra provided strong reasoning as to why she believed it outperformed the other models.
- Sandra mentioned that although the Polynomial Features (Degree=3) model had better metrics than the other models it might not be as reliable if the data is smaller, which I thought was a really interesting observation.
- She also mentioned how scaling was important to the model and how it impacted the selected features.

### Reflection Quality
- Reflections were well thought out and explained.
- Sandra went into detail about each model and it's findings with well thought out summaries and interesting observations.
- In her final thought, she mentioned that the feature of `smoking` had the most significant impact on charges, with smokers paying considerably more. As I was observing her different models I noticed that trend as well, but I like how she highlighted this in her final thoughts.
- Overall, Sandra did a great job on the project and I thoughourly enjoyed reading through it.
